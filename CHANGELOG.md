# v2.0.0 2018-04-27

## Changes since last release

* Make LDP optional (Add `gem ldp` to Gemfile if using Fedora)
* Make ActiveRecord optional (Add `gem activerecord` to Gemfile if using
  Postgres)
* Make RSolr optional (Add `gem rsolr` to Gemfile if using Solr)
* Remove deprecated `standardize_query_result` argument.
* Remove deprecated `Valkyrie::ID#to_uri`
* Remove ActiveFedora as a dependency.
* Remove deprecated `Valkyrie::Persistence::Fedora::PermissiveSchema.alternate_ids`
* Remove deprecated `Valkyrie::Persistence::Fedora::PermissiveSchema.references`
* Upgrade `dry-types` to `0.13.x`
* Fedora Adapter default is now version 5.
* Require a symbol key when instantiating a Valkyrie::Resource (string keys are no longer valid)
* Remove deprecated `type.member()` method (use `type.of()`)
* Remove deprecated `Valkyrie::Types::Int` (use `Valkyrie::Types::Integer`)

## Changes Without Deprecations in `1.6.0`

1. Overriding an attribute getter no longer changes the output of `to_h`. If
   you've overridden something via `def title; "overwritten"; end`, then `to_h`
   will now have what was set via the setter or initializer, not `overwritten`.
2. Setting attribute values via overriding instance variables no longer works.
   Please use `#set_value` if you need dynamic setting, as this will be a stable
   API.
3. `Valkyrie::Resource#to_h` no longer includes keys with `nil` values.

## Upgrade Guide

1. Upgrade Valkyrie to `1.6.0` in your application, run tests, and fix all
   deprecations output to console.
2. Upgrade Valkyrie to `2.0.0` in your application.
3. Failing tests at this point are likely due to behavior in the "Changes
   Without Deprecations" section above. If you have any trouble, please contact
   us in the #valkyrie channel in [Samvera Slack](http://slack.samvera.org/).

## New Product Owner

All of us who have been part of the Valkyrie project so far would like to thank
[Carolyn Cole](https://github.com/carolyncole) for her role so far as Product Owner.
We'd like to welcome [Kate Lynch](https://github.com/kelynch), who will be
taking over effective immediately!

## Special Thanks

This is the first major version of Valkyrie since 1.0 over a year ago. A lot of
work has gone into it, and I'd like to take the chance to thank everyone
involved for their contributions in the last year:
